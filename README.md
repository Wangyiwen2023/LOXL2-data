# LOXL2-data
Data folder:
1'.pdb,1.pdb, 2.pdb, 3.pdb, S1.pdb, S2.pdb, S3.pdb, S4.pdb, U1.pdb, Z1.pdb and Z2.pdb are the coordinates for the 1', 1, 2, 3, S1, S2, S3, S4, U1, Z1 and Z2 states, respectively.

Input folder:
3Å-cu-input.msj: The input file of the metadynamics with copper ion binding. The distance between the CD2 atom on Tyr689 and the NZ atom on Lys653 is 3 Å initially. 
3Å-zn-input.msj: The similar simulation as 3Å-cu-input.msj but with zinc ion.
Cu2+-binding-input.msj: The input file of the metadynamics with 3 as initial structure.
Zn2+-binding-input.msj: The similar simulation as Cu2+-binding-input.msj but with zinc ion.
4-state.msj: Input file of metadynamics for LTQ activation process.
